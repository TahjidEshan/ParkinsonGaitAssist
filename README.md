# Gait-assistive-aid-for-Parkinson-patients--Edge-ML-approach.
Parkinson disease patients suffer from "Freezing of Gait"(FOG)  events during daily normal activities. Medical research has shown Rhythmic auditory cueing can recover normal gait when freezing events occur. The occurence of FOG events are detected using body worn accelerometer based systems. This system can be made more cheaper and scalable with implementation of low sized ML models.
